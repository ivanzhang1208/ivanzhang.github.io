### Research Experiences
#### ChatGPT detection tool development (based on NLP, computational linguistics, and metadata)
March -May 2023  
•	be responsible for developing resources for projects.  
•	collecting and analyzing evaluation data at various stages of the project performing literature review   

#### Foreign Object Detection in X optical image based on Machine Vision
May 2018-March 2019  
•	Implemented segmentation of the X-ray image by automatic threshold method.   
•	Optimized the selection of feature parameters of pattern recognition to serve as the criterion of classification.  
•	Designed the SVM classifier which has high recognition rate and can automatically classify various foreign bodies.  
Production:  Proposed a foreign body recognition method based on SVM for food image.  

#### Image Segmentation of Cow via Weak Supervision
September 2017-March 2018  
•	Constructed segmentation of images into regions with consistent image features (color and texture features, etc.) by Mean-Shift algorithm.  
•	Conducted the preprocession of the image and extracting the saliency map.  
•	Achieved the optimal semantic segmentation of cow image by eliminating over segmentation by chain code difference.  
Production:  Proposed an effective algorithm of cow image semantic segmentation based on weak supervision.  

### Activities
